## Author's note
- Backups are not encrypted, still working on that.

- This project is still in development and may not be complete. Please use it at your own risk.

- I'm now just getting used to working with AES-128 encryption and I'm still learning about it.

- My python maybe messy and wack, please give me any feedback you can.
